			<p>Cephalids are humanoids with octopus-like features, native to the long lost seas and lakes of Old Capenna. They possess tentacles that act as facial and head hair, and retain many cephalopod traits, including color-changing markings controlled by their emotions, three hearts, and a boneless anatomy that allows them to "pour" themselves into tight spaces. Their natural talent for stealth and subterfuge make them favored by the Obscura family, who are always looking for spies.</p>
