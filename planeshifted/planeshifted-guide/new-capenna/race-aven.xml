			<p>The aven are a race of anthropomorphic birdfolk, possessing feathers, beaks, and wings. The aven are quite diverse, with a wide range of feather colorations and beak shapes, often bearing a striking resemblance to various breeds of birds. Many aven are corvid in appearance, but other breeds include Eagle, Doves, Falcons, Hawks, Hummingbirds, Owls, and Pigeons.</p>
	
			<h4>AVEN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Small or Medium (choose when you select this race).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Beak.</em></strong> You have a sharp beak that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier piercing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Flight.</em></strong> Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Powerful Wings.</em></strong> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a gust of wind from your wings in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
