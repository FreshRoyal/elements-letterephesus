			<p>Shapeshifters are incredibly rare in New Capenna, and there is little known about them. In their natural form, they appear as glowing humanoids of raw magical energy with no real defining features, and they possess the ability to change their form to match other races, including features they don't appear to possess such as skin and hair.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because of their abilities, they are both highly feared and highly sought after by the crime families in New Capenna.</p>
