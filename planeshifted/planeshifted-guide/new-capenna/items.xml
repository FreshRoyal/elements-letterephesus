	<element name="Telephone" type="Magic Item" source="Planeshifted Guide to New Capenna" id="ID_PSLE_PSGNC_MAGIC_ITEM_TELEPHONE">
		<description>
			<p>A telephone is a modern communication device, consisting of a rotary dial and a earpiece/mouthpiece connected by a cable. Most telephones are stationary, but modern magic allows for some telephones to be portable, carried in a small handbag. Each telephone has a unique number sequence used to contact it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Make a Call.</em></strong> You can use your action while holding the telephone to dial another telephone whose number sequence you know. The target telephone rings audibly out to 100 feet. Another creature can use its action to pick up the earpiece of the target telephone and receive the call, which ends the ringing sound and connects the two telephones until either creature uses their action to hang the earpiece and end the call. While the telephones are connected, the two creatures can communicate with each other verbally as though they were next to each other.</p>
