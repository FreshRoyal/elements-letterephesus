			<p>Elves have a similar appearance to humans, but can be distinguished from them by their pointed ears, and a pair of small horns jutting from their foreheads. It is unknown if they share any ancestry with humans or ogres; that knowledge has been lost to time. It is known, however, that the elves numbered among the ancient druids of the Kingdom Era, and as such can be found mostly among members of the Cabaretti family.</p>
