		<description>
			<p>Tuskeri society is chaotic and revolves around glory and boasting. They are driven to complete dangerous feats and go on wild adventuresâ€”the kind of adventures that become sagas sung for generations. They all aim to perform bigger, better feats than anyone else in all the realms and goad each other into attempting outlandish tests of strength and skill. They frequently visit Axgard in search of dwarf skalds to accompany them on their never-ending adventures, since the word of a skald is the closest possible thing to proof of a story's veracity.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Tuskeri like to go to war and usually don't need any excuse beyond being bored, realizing they haven't had a good fight in a while, or hearing someone say something more insulting than usual. They are very enthusiastic but disorganized fighters, with no appetite for strategy or careful tactics. Rather, each individual fighter attempts the most over-the-top heroic feats they can dream up, regardless of what their allies are doing. Nothing is more glorious to them than dying heroically in battle; not coincidentally, Tuskeri warriors are also more likely than those of any other clan to be spirited away by the Valkyries to the glory of Starnheim.</p>
			<p class="indent">Leadership among the Tuskeri falls to the clan member who is seen as the strongest, boldest, and most accomplished at any given time. The position of leader can be bestowed as a reward for particularly remarkable feats, which means that the office can pass at any time to the next warrior who achieves something incredible.</p>
