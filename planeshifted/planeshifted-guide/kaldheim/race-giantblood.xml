		<description>
			<p>So named after Tover Giants-blood, an enormous Kannah Warrior, a giantblood is a human of any clan descent who has a giant's ancestry. The blood of the giant runs strong in the veins of men, and overpowers whatever natural talent a clansman might possess.</p>
			<h4>GIANTS</h4>
			<p>The frost and fire giants of the realm of Surtland are locked in constant conflict. Frost giants are intelligent and secretive, using runic magic to divine the secrets of the Cosmos and jealously guarding them against the curiosity of outsiders. Frost giant wizards called Vela Mages dwell primarily in the well-protected Vela Heights. They have a special relationship with the similar-minded Omenseekers of Bretagard, who sail to Surtland occasionally to trade information with friendly frost giants.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fire giants, by contrast, are brutal and impulsive, sharing their kin's physical strength and resilience but lacking any of the frost giants' knowledge and resources. Fire giants dwell in the lower elevations of Surtland where snowfields are divided by deep lava fissures. They live together in families and clans, building crude wooden structures from the realm's massive trees. They're smaller than frost giants, but they're still giants and are incredibly tough, strong, and resilient. They love hand-to-hand combat, but they're not above throwing boulders at their enemies, and their wizards have power over fire and lava.</p>
