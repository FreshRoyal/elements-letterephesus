		<description>
			<p>The dwarves of the realm of Axgard are renowned through all the realms for two things: perfect weapons and exquisite storytelling. They are passionately creative, with an insatiable longing to constantly improve their craft. They strive to create the sharpest swords, the most beautiful jewelry, the strongest chainsâ€”and then immortalize their deeds in song and story. They seek to build things that last, to make their mark on the world so future generations remember them.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dwarven society takes the form of sprawling, loose-knit clans that congregate in certain sections of the underground city. Different clans specialize in different crafts, and though they coexist amicably enough, they also have a strong competitive streak that sometimes sets them at odds. For dwarves, a warrior and a skilled artisan are one and the same. The art of combat and the art of creation draw from the same principles of focus, patience, and constant self-improvement.</p>
			<h4>IRON CURRENCY</h4>
			<p>Thanks to the Goldmaw Chasm, an endless supply of bubbling liquid gold in the dwarven realm of Axgard, gold is so readily available as to be nearly worthless in dwarven culture. Axgard currency is made from iron, valued for its utility, rather than its rarity.</p>
			<h4>DWARF NAMES</h4>
			<p>Every dwarf artisan spends their youth forging a single weapon and infusing it with runic magic, preparing to carry it for their entire life. These weapons are their creators' pride and joy, and many dwarves design their clothing and armor to match their weapon. On a dwarf's 100th birthday, marking the start of adulthood, they will reveal the weapon and their new last name, chosen based on their great creation.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Example Last Names:</strong> Bloodhammer, Goldstaff, Hammershine, Fireshield, Realmsword</p>
