			<p>The elves live in the realm of Skemfar. Their ancestors actually used to be gods, the Einir, before being replaced by the modern pantheon of the Skoti. After their defeat, the leaders of the elvish Einir were imprisoned inside the Jaspera trees and the race was split into two clans: The Wood elves and Shadow elves. These two factions were alienated from each other for ages until recently, when an elf named Harald the Elder united the warring clans and named himself king. The elves are looking to reclaim their place as the gods of the realms, and the reunification of their society is a step toward that goal.</p>
			<p class="indent">Elven tradition reveres Koma, the cosmos serpent. Many elves wear clothing that reflects that reverenceâ€”from hair braided to look like scales to woven designs and actual snakeskin. Their realm of Skemfar is full of the tunnels he left behind while he still moved freely in the realms. After he was cast out from the realms by the Skoti, some elves take it upon themselves to tend to these tunnels dutifully, praying for Koma to return and restore the elves to power.</p>
			<h4>ELVEN EQUIPMENT</h4>
			<p>Elves traditionally carry weapons and wear armor made from an ancient, bronze-like metal. Each weapon is custom smithed for a single elf and is carried through that elf's lifetime, then melted down and re-shaped for their descendants.</p>
