		<description>
			<p>The valkyries dwell in Starnheim, where fallen heroes rest. Older than the Skoti, the Valkyries do not serve the gods. They were formed at the beginning of time, birthed from Valkmir, the black lake of the first valkyrie's blood in Starnheim. Valkyries judge the fallen, and do not allow their judgment to be clouded by the banal relationships, family ties, and petty squabbling that practically define the nature of the gods.</p>
			<p class="indent">Valkyries carry out their missions of judgment in pairs, a Shepherd and a Reaper travel together. Shepherds guide the honored dead to Starnheim, while Reapers take cowards to the realm of Istfell, branding them with a rune that marks their shame. Both Valkyries in a pair must agree on each fallen warrior's fate before it can be enacted.</p>
			<p class="indent">Though valkyries becoming involved in outside affairs is rare, some sagas describe the valkyries joining the gods in a worthy battle, and valkyries will readily fly into battle against demons.</p>
