		<description>
			<p>The Aldergard forest is home to the nomadic Kannah clan, who maintain temporary settlements in the forest but regularly send groups on exploratory expeditions. The Aldergard is so large that some Kannah wander for years without ever leaving the forest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Near the eastern edge of the forest, in the highlands rising into the Tusk Mountains, stands the Cursed Treeâ€”a massive oak that is perpetually covered in snow. Kannah sagas say that this is the site where a god cursed them to remain forever in the Aldergard, with no hope of entering the hallowed halls of Starnheim. If the Kannah leave the forest, winter follows them and torments them with constant, increasing snowfall, eventually making forward progress impossible and forcing them to turn back. The Kannah maintain a small settlement near the Cursed Tree, where they perform runic rituals in hopes that one day the curse will be lifted.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanks to their ill treatment at the hands of divine beings, the Kannah despise anything related to gods, including the Cosmos monsters. They believe that killing the Cosmos Serpent will give them enough power to rise up and destroy the Skoti, end the curse at last, and claim Starnheim for themselves.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Kannah are led by Fynn Fangbearer, formerly Snakehunter. He was the only human who ever managed to wound the Cosmos Serpent, and ultimately defeated it after it was compleated during the Phyrexian invasion.</p>
