	<element name="Ancestral Katana" type="Magic Item" source="Planeshifted Guide to Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty" id="ID_PSLE_PSGKND_MAGIC_ITEM_ANCESTRAL_KATANA">
		<description>
			<p>While anyone can pass on a sword, an ancestral katana is one that has remained with a clan, tribe, or family line for generations, being well maintained and repaired. It is believed that the blade is connected to a kami that embodies the family's deeds and memory, and this kami gives the blade its strength.</p>
			<p class="indent">An ancestral katana passes down from parent to child, though this relation does not have to be by blood. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword loses its magic and becomes a normal longsword, fading into obscurity.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Defensive.</em></strong> While you are holding this longsword, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Battōjutsu.</em></strong> When you draw this longsword as part of the first attack you make on your first turn in combat and hit a creature, the longsword deals an extra 3d8 damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>You Are Already Dead.</em></strong> When you attack a Large or smaller creature with this longsword and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut straight through the creature, bisecting and slaying it. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, is formless, amorphous, or incorporeal, can regenerate, has legendary actions, or the DM otherwise decides the creature cannot be killed by bisection. Such a creature instead takes an extra 3d8 slashing damage from the hit.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo depicts various beasts, kami, and oni in the ukiyo-e style.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tattoo Attunement.</em></strong> To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.</p>
			<p class="indent">If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Otherworldly Assassin.</em></strong> The tattoo has 3 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As an action while the tattoo is on your skin, you can expend 1 of the tattoo's charges to cause a kami to emerge from the tattoo and lunge at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

	<element name="Blade of the Oni" type="Magic Item" source="Planeshifted Guide to Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty" id="ID_PSLE_PSGKND_MAGIC_ITEM_BLADE_OF_THE_ONI">
		<description>
			<p>A blade of the oni is an ogre-forged weapon of obsidian, fashioned with menacing spikes.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> A blade of the oni is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> A blade of the oni is possessed by an oni, and as such embodies selfish aspects. It values these qualities in others and bonds well with a wielder who displays them, while showing contempt for wielders who are self-sacrificial for others.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Reconfigure.</em></strong> If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the sword to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the sword becomes an oni. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.</p>
			<p class="indent">The oni exists for 1 hour. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its sword form. It reverts to a sword early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action while touching it. When the creature becomes a sword again, its property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> This greatsword is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. With each passing day while you are cursed, your physical appearance changes to become more like an oni spirit. After seven days, a third eye opens vertically on your forehead, recognizable as the mark of the oni. Thereafter, your creature type changes to Fiend for as long as you remain cursed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A communicator is a pocket-sized electronic device used for instantaneous communication. Each communicator has a unique number sequence used to contact it. The communicator can be keyed to a creature’s fingerprint or semblance. An unauthorized creature proficient with hacking tools can bypass this key with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Send a Message.</em></strong> You can touch the communicator and use your action to cast the <i>sending</i> spell from it. The target is another communicator whose unique sequence of numbers you know. To do so, you type the message into the communicator's holographic interface. Your message appears in the holographic interface of the target communicator and can be viewed by any creature holding it. The message remains in the communicator until a creature uses its action to delete it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Make a Call.</em></strong> You can touch the communicator and use your action to attempt to cast <i>magic mouth</i> from it. The target is another communicator whose unique sequence of numbers you know. A creature holding the target communicator may accept or refuse your call.

			<p>Komainu are guardian lion statues often placed at kami shrines. While originally made of stone, the modern age of Kamigawa has seen them become mechanized constructs that can actually guard and defend the shrines. They can also transform into suits of armor to protect and empower kami intercessors.</p>

				<li>Your walking speed is 50 ft.</li>
				<li>You gain a +2 bonus to AC.</li>
				<li>The armor includes gauntlets, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, the strike deals 1d8 slashing damage, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Reconfigure.</em></strong> If you use an action to speak the command word, the armor leaves you and becomes a lion, except it's a Construct, it's immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and it doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The creature appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature reverts to its magic item form if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action while touching it. When the creature becomes armor again, its property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The reality chip is an illegal bio-enhancement created by the moonfolk futurist Tameshi with help from a being from another plane. The chip is rumored to be able to influence the physics of reality. It appears as a Tiny computer chip with translucent wire-like arms. It superficially resembles a jellyfish.</p>
			<p class="indent">While attuned to the reality chip, you gain a +3 bonus to AC, and you can read, write, and understand Phyrexian. When you attune to the reality chip, the chip's arms attach to your skin.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The chip has 5 charges, and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells: <i>dominate beast</i> (2 charges), <i>dominate person</i> (2 charges), <i>creation</i> (2 charges), <i>dominate monster</i> (3 charges), <i>reverse gravity</i> (3 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> While attuned to the reality chip, you suffer frequent visions and nightmares of the Phyrexian Jin-Gitaxis.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Reconfigure.</em></strong> If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the reality chip to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, it becomes a creature with the statistics of a <strong>sea horse</strong>, except it's a Construct, it's immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and it doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature reverts to its magic item form if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action while touching it. When the creature becomes armor again, its property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Crashing.</em></strong> The controller of a cyberbike can run the vehicle into another object or a creature by moving the vehicle into the target's space and making a special attack roll (1d20 + the controller's proficiency bonus) against the target's Armor Class. If the attack roll hits, a crash occurs; otherwise, the target moves out of the vehicle's path, avoiding the crash. If the DM decides that a crash is unavoidable, no attack roll is necessary, and the crash occurs automatically.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a cyberbike crashes into something that could reasonably damage it, both the cyberbike and the creature or object it struck take bludgeoning damage based on the size of the struck object, as shown in the Crash Damage table. The cyberbike stops after crashing into a Gargantuan or immovable creature or object; otherwise, the cyberbike can continue moving if it has any movement left, and whatever it struck moves to the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the cyberbike's path. If the cyberbike stops after crashing, its controller falls, landing prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of of the cyberbike.</p>
