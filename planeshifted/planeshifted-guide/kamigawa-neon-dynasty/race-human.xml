			<p>Humans in Kamigawa are believed to come from the central plains of Towabara, where they were once ruled by the daimyo, feudal warlords. They are the progenitors and main citizens of the Empire, which was formed at the end of the Kami War to help Kyodai, the kami of the realm, to maintain the peace between the spirit and mortal worlds. Humans are also known for having befriended and trained the giant moths of Kamigawa as mounts, which the Imperials often ride into battle, and for having started Minamo Academy long before the Kami war.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the modern era, humans can be found throughout Kamigawa in its many villages and cities, and among all of the various groups and factions found in the plane, showing their adaptability and versatility.</p>
