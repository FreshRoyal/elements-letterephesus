		<description>
			<p>The Nezumi are a race of anthropomorphic rats native to the Takenuma swamps. In times past, Kamigawa's other races ostracized and stereotyped the nezumi. Though in recent years the feelings toward the nezumi have softened, they are still oftentimes seen as outsiders in the Empire and its lands.</p>
			<p class="indent">The nezumi traditionally live in independent swamp villages, or in roaming nezumi gangs. Nezumi did not have magical traditions until the theft of scrolls from Minamo Academy; nezumi then developed unique practices, such as that of the insect-shaman, sometimes called a miser, who can control swarms of Takenuma insects. These shamans also developed bone-reading, a type of divination. With the advent of technology, some nezumi samurai practice the bladeblessing, combining technology and magic to enhance their weaponry, while the nezumi of the legendary Okiba reckoner gang are renowned for being the best engineers and pilots of cyberbikes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nezumi have a wide range of gray and brown fur colors. They are characteristically smaller and lighter than other races, and so make naturally adept ninjas, spies, scouts, and pilots.</p>

			<h4>NEZUMI NAMES</h4>
			<p>Nezumi have their own language in which they name themselves, but they often use translated names in the common tongue when among others. Nezumi names are usually compound words that describe the physical characteristics, personality traits, or professional habits of the person.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Example Names:</strong> Ashcoat, Black-nose, Greasefang, Ink-eyes, Marrow-gnawer, Nighteyes, Silver-fur, Skullsnatcher, Stabwhisker, Split-tail</p>
