		<description>
			<p>Kappa are mysterious, water-dwelling folk native to Kamigawa. Little is known about them, but kappa superficially resemble turtles, including having shells on their back like akki. Before the Kami War, it was believed they were extinct. The Shell of the Last Kappa was a relic of considerable magical power and was kept at a shrine.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kappa have since re-emerged from somewhere beneath the waves of lake Kamitaki. Some of these resurgent kappa have a penchant for wrecking technology, while others have been known to make unique use of it, such as incorporating firearms into their shells.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are many legends surrounding the kappa; namely, that they love cucumbers and this weakness can be exploited by their enemies. Furthermore, it is said that the bowl on their head which collects water is the source of their power. Given how rare kappas are, no one can reliably verify these legends.</p>

			<h4>KAPPA NAMES</h4>
			<p>Kappas use monikers instead of proper names, similar to how many kami spirits are named for the idea or subject they represent. Kappa monikers are given or chosen for the character personalities of the kappa who bear them. With those close to them, kappa may use nicknames that derive from these monikers.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Example Names:</strong> He-who-sculpts-figures-of-bronze, He-who-wrecks-technology, He-of-never-ending-hunger, She-of-ever-following-eyes</p>

			<h4>KAPPA TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> You can breathe both air and water.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Kappa Sara.</em></strong> Your head crests into a dish that can hold water. As long as the dish is full of water, you have advantage on ability checks you make to initiate or escape a grapple.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Natural Armor.</em></strong> Because of your shell, your base Armor Class is 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can't wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shell Defense.</em></strong> You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your Armor Class, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p>
