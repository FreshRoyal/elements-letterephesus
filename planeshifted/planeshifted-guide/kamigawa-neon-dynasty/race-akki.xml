		<description>
			<p>Akki are a race of goblins native to Kamigawa's Sokenzan mountains; an ancestral homeland they share with the ogres. The akki are short and have skin that comes in a variety of red and brown hues, with a pair of tiny horns sticking out from their head, four-fingered hands and three-fingered toes with long claws, and no external ears. Akki have small, wiry bodies, but their backs are protected by large turtle-like shells covered in short spikes; these shells evolved over the years as akki pranks got more and more self-destructive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Traditionally, akki form territorial tribes, which consist of warriors and shamans, led by a tribe elder. When akki encounter trespassers, they begin by trying to ward away the offender with small-time pranks usually involving fire and rocks, which slowly escalate in danger if the first few don't do the trick. During the time of the Kami War, many akki joined with the ronin and Godo's Bandits.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the modern era, sensibilities toward akki have improved, and many rank among respected blacksmiths and samurai. With the advent of technology, akki have taken the unique practice of salvaging mechs and painting them in bright war paint; perhaps reminiscent of akki tribal cave inscriptions.</p>

			<h4>AKKI NAMES</h4>
			<p>As a general rule, akki names consist of a reduplicated word; a word that has the same sound repeated twice, or a very similar sound, with no differentiation given for gender. Akki are not known to take family names.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Example Names:</strong> Ai-Ai, Ben-Ben, Goro-Goro, Ishi-Ishi, Keni-Keni, Kiki-Jiki, Ku-Ku, Lim-Lim, Oku-Doku, Rin-Rin, Tok-Tok, Uppo-Uppo, Zo-Zu</p>
