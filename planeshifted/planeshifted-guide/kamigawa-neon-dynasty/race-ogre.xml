			<p>Known as o-bakemono, the ogres of Kamigawa are more intelligent than ogres of other worlds and possess considerable brute cunning. They originated in the Sokenzan Mountains, though most of their ancestors migrated to the swamps of Takenuma. They are taller than the other humanoids on average, with stockier builds. They have pointed ears and sharp nails, skin tones that range from reddish browns to purplish gray, and most have horns that protrude from their foreheads.</p>
			<p class="indent">Traditionally, o-bakemono worshipped the oni, in contrast to the reverence of kami spirits by other cultures. Oni manifest from selfish and destructive concepts, which the o-bakemono view as necessary aspects of life. Their culture is defined by such concepts, valuing the power and strength of each individual. O-bakemono worshipped the oni with blood rites and sacrifices of living sentients in exchange for gifts of strength and supernatural powers. With the advent of the Kami War, the o-bakemono succeeded in freeing many of their oni masters from their spiritual prisons, together hoping to reshape Kamigawa on these principles.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the modern day, o-bakemono culture has diversified. There are some villages and communities that still worship the oni, but many who do not, seeing the value in peace and community. Some o-bakemono even choose to become monks and worship the kami. O-bakemono who seek to distance themselves from the oni have a tradition of cutting off or shaving down their horns. Though they suffer a fearsome reputation, many seek to make peace and can be found in cities such as Towashi.</p>
