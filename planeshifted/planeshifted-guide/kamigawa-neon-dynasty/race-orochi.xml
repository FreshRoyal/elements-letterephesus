		<description>
			<p>Orochi are anthropomorphic four-armed snakefolk who originally inhabited the Jukai Forest of Kamigawa. Their culture revolves around reverence for the kami of the land and nature, and their magic is noticeably tied to the seasons. Orochi traditionally live in colonies, built with a unique egg-like architecture. Orochi eggs are tended by a Broodmistress and her Eggwatchers. Orochi colonies are interestingly devoid of tombstones; by tradition, the dead are buried with a tree sapling, so they would become a part of the forest after death.</p>
			<p class="indent">The orochi form three distinct tribes: the Kashi tribe, who house and breed warriors; the Matsu tribe, who raise spies and scouts; and the Sakura tribe, who preserve the orochi rituals and teachings.</p>
			<p class="indent">In ages past, the orochi had legs like any other humanoid race in Kamigawa. After the Kami War, the orochi were forced out of their home, and they appealed to the kami for help. The kirin answered their call, but demanded the orochi give up their limbs as payment. When the orochi hastily agreed, the kirin had pity on them, taking only their legs and granting them access to greater magical power.</p>

			<h4>OROCHI NAMES</h4>
			<p>Almost all orochi have names that begin with an 'S' sound, and often contain more than one S in the rest of the name. Orochi do not use family names, but may use their tribe name as a surname.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Male Names:</strong> Sadao, Satoshi, Senichi, Seshiro, Sitsusuro, Shizuko, Shoichi, Sosuke</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Female Names:</strong> Sachiko, Sakiko, Sasaya, Sayuri, Setsuko, Shidako, Shisato, Shinose</p>
