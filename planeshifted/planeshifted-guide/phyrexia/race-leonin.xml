			<p>As with all creatures on New Phyrexia, the Leonin have partially metallic features, though the extent can vary wildly among their race. They once lived in the Razor Fields, their capital being Taj-Nar, the Ancient Den.</p>
			<p class="indent">Leonin culture is highly honor-based and religious, worshipping the white sun. Clerics of the sun have to survive a year on the blasted surface of the plane before they are regarded as full abunas (clerics) that are allowed to lead other Leonin in religious ceremonies.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Leonin share a unique bond with the pterons, large flying reptiles. Specialized leonin Skyhunters use the beasts as mounts and ride them into battle against the Phyrexians.</p>
			<h4>Leonin Traits</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium (about 6-7 feet tall).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cat's Grace.</em></strong> You don't take fall damage from falling 20 feet or less as long as you aren't incapacitated.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cat's Talent.</em></strong> You have proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> You have sharp claws which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Daunting Roar.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can let out an especially menacing roar. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
