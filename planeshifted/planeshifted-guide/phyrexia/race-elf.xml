			<p>As all organic life on New Phyrexia, the Viridian elves are partly inorganic, growing copper from their flesh as a result of the mycosynth that touches everything on the plane. Their organic skin can appear in shades of pale white and bright green.</p>
			<p class="indent">The elves once resided in the forest of copper trees known as the Tangle. Even before the Phyrexianization of the plane, the Viridian elves were enemies of inorganic and mechanical constructs, frequently coming into conflict with the Myr and the drones created by the Vedalken.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Viridian elves once looked to the trolls of Tel-Jilad for guidance. The trolls considered the Tel-Jilad (the "Tree of Tales") their sacred home, and they lived within its hollow core. Though the trolls are all but extinct, the elves still hold the Tel-Jilad in reverence. Inscribed into its metal surface is the history of Mirrodin, except near the bottom where all the writings have been etched out.</p>
			<p class="indent">Due to their long lives, elves will engage in a ceremony known as the Ritual of Rebuking, in which an older elf has their memories erased so that they can start anew and focus on the tasks at hand.</p>
