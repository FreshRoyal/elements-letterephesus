			<p>Goblins, like all other creatures on New Phyrexia, have patches of metal growing on their skin. These goblins also have flat heads with swept-back, sharply-pointed ears, four-fingered hands, and sharp claws on their fingers and toes. They have a natural talent for artifice.</p>
			<p class="indent">Goblin social structure is largely chaotic, but the priesthood has significant power. The priests mostly focus on fertility and offerings of metal, which inspire raids, and are responsible for rites concerning the Steel Mother. The Steel Mother is a deity that the goblins believe created the plane and controls all metal. It was believed by the goblins that by sacrificing all metals and dead bodies to the Kuldotha, the furnace-city the objects and souls would be returned to the Steel Mother, and keep the Furnace running for her. The melted metal from sacrificed bodies was reclaimed and reforged into weapons and armor. Since the Phyrexianization, the Kuldotha has become part of the Autonomous Furnace of the Phyrexians, and goblin shamans desperately seek to reclaim it.</p>
