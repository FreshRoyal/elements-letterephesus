			<h4>NAGA TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> You can use your fanged maw to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier piercing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blindsight.</em></strong> You can perceive your surroundings within 10 feet of you without relying on sight. You can't detect Constructs or Undead this way.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Poison Bite.</em></strong> As an action, you can make a special unarmed strike with your Bite. If the strike hits, it deals its normal damage, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus or or be poisoned until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Serpentine Build.</em></strong> You can use your serpentine body to grapple a creature while leaving your hands free. You have advantage on ability checks you make to initiate a grapple this way.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shed Skin.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can end one condition on yourself from among blinded, deafened, grappled, paralyzed, poisoned, or restrained. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
