			<p>Aven are winged humanoids who bear the heads of birds—falcons or ibises. You can learn more about aven in <i>Plane Shift: Amonkhet</i>.</p>
			<h4>AVEN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Beak.</em></strong> You have a beak that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier piercing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>

			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Falcon-Headed.</strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
