			<p>Khenra are lithe jackal humanoids, often born as twins. You can learn more about khenra in <i>Plane Shift: Amonkhet</i>.</p>
			<h4>KHENRA TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> You can use your fanged maw to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier piercing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Khenra Twin.</em></strong> You gain an additional benefit based on one of the following options (choose when you select this race):</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Twin Tactics.</strong> You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Twinless.</strong> You are immune to the frightened condition.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>Twin-Dependent</h5>
				<p>If you lose your khenra twin during the course of your campaign, your DM may allow you to replace your Twin Tactics trait with the Twinless trait, and vice versa if you reunite with your twin.</p>
